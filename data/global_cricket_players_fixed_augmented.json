      "situation_response": "Rohit exhibits 'Cognitive Decoupling'—the ability to separate the match importance from the physical delivery. During high-leverage overs (e.g., 2025 CT Final), his HR fluctuations remain under 8%, preventing the 'motor-skill breakdown' common in high-stress scenarios.",
      "clutch_play_style": "In pressure chases, he shifts from high-arousal aggression to 'Calculative Risk.' He uses a 3-step loop: Identifying the weak-link bowler, manipulating field depth via trigger movements, and executing high-exit-velocity shots. This minimizes late-game panic.",
      "mental_toughness_rating": "9.8/10",
      "leadership_under_fire": "Demonstrates 'Low-Arousal Leadership,' where his calm exterior acts as a biological regulator for younger teammates, lowering their systemic cortisol levels during tense moments.",
      "routine_strength": "Ritualistic 'glove-tightening' and 'sight-screen checks' serve as neurological reset triggers to maintain focus."
